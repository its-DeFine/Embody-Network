# 🧪 Testing Roadmap for 24/7 Trading System

## Overview

The testing strategy is organized into three distinct categories that mirror the system architecture:

1. **🔒 Security Tests** - Validate authentication, authorization, and security measures

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Tests by Category

```bash
# Security tests only
python3 scripts/run_tests.py security

# Central manager tests only  
python3 scripts/run_tests.py central-manager

# Container logic tests only
python3 scripts/run_tests.py container

# All tests
python3 scripts/run_tests.py all

# Or using pytest directly with markers
pytest -m security -v
pytest -m central_manager -v  
pytest -m container -v
```
