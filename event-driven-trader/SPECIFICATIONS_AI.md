# AI-Powered Event-Driven Trading System Specifications

## Overview
An intelligent trading system combining event-driven architecture with AutoGen AI teams for sophisticated market analysis and decision-making.

## Core AI Components

### 1. AutoGen Trading Teams
Multiple specialized AI agents working together:

#### Market Analysis Team
- **Technical Analyst Agent**: Analyzes price patterns, indicators
- **Fundamental Analyst Agent**: Evaluates market conditions, news
- **Risk Manager Agent**: Assesses risk/reward ratios
- **Coordinator Agent**: Synthesizes team insights

#### Execution Team  
- **Entry Strategist Agent**: Determines optimal entry points
- **Exit Strategist Agent**: Manages take profits and stop losses
- **Position Sizer Agent**: Calculates optimal position sizes

### 2. Event-Driven AI Integration

#### AI-Enhanced Events
```yaml
ai_events:
  - name: "ai_market_analysis"
    interval: 60  # Every minute
    handler: "AIMarketAnalysisHandler"
    autogen_team: "market_analysis_team"
    
  - name: "ai_signal_generation"
    trigger: "on_analysis_complete"
    handler: "AISignalHandler"
    autogen_team: "execution_team"
```

#### AI Decision Flow
1. **Event Triggers** → AutoGen team activation
2. **Team Deliberation** → Agents discuss and analyze
3. **Consensus Building** → Team reaches decision
4. **Signal Generation** → Trading signal with confidence
5. **Execution** → Trade placement with AI reasoning

### 3. AutoGen Team Configuration

```python
class MarketAnalysisTeam:
    agents = [
        {
            "name": "technical_analyst",
            "role": "Analyze price action and technical indicators",
            "model": "gpt-4",
            "tools": ["price_data", "indicators", "patterns"]
        },
        {
            "name": "fundamental_analyst", 
            "role": "Evaluate market sentiment and fundamentals",
            "model": "gpt-4",
            "tools": ["news_api", "sentiment_analysis"]
        },
        {
            "name": "risk_manager",
            "role": "Assess risk levels and position sizing",
            "model": "gpt-4",
            "tools": ["portfolio_stats", "risk_metrics"]
        }
    ]
```

## Enhanced Architecture

### Event Loop with AI
```
Event Loop
  ├── Time Events → AI Analysis Handler
  ├── API Events → AI Signal Handler
  └── AI Events → AutoGen Team Activation
```

### AI Decision Pipeline
```
Market Data → AutoGen Analysis Team → Signal Generation
                    ↓
              Team Discussion
                    ↓
            Consensus Decision
                    ↓
         AI Trading Handler → Execute Trade
```

## AI-Powered Event Handlers

## Configuration with AI

```yaml
ai_config:
  autogen:
    api_key: "your_openai_key"
    model: "gpt-4"
    temperature: 0.7
    max_rounds: 5  # Max discussion rounds
    
  teams:
    market_analysis:
      min_confidence: 70  # Minimum consensus confidence
      agents: ["technical", "fundamental", "risk"]
      
    execution:
      min_confidence: 80
      agents: ["entry", "exit", "sizer"]
      
  risk_limits:
    max_ai_position_size: 30  # % of portfolio per AI trade
    daily_ai_trade_limit: 10
```
