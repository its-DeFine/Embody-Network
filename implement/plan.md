# Implementation Plan - Distributed Container Management System

## Project Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Repository Cleanup**: Clean up repo for production readiness
2. **Distributed Container Detection**: Central manager detects remote container instances/clusters  
3. **Remote Agent Management**: Launch and manage agents on remote containers via central manager
4. **Container Orchestration**: Seamless multi-container agent deployment

## Phase 1: Repository Cleanup ✅

### Cleanup Tasks
- [ ] Remove temporary/test files not needed for production
- [ ] Organize development vs production files  
- [ ] Clean up Docker configurations
- [ ] Remove redundant test scripts
- [ ] Consolidate documentation
- [ ] Clean up root directory structure

### Files to Remove/Reorganize
- [ ] `central_manager_test.py` (dev only)
- [ ] `simple_manager_test.py` (dev only)  
- [ ] `test_agent_container.py` (dev only)
- [ ] `test_real_container.py` (dev only)
- [ ] `full_manager_test.py` (dev only)
- [ ] `full_system_test.py` (dev only)
- [ ] `api_demo.py` (dev only)
- [ ] `container_dashboard.py` (move to scripts/)
- [ ] `dashboard_data.json` (temporary file)
- [ ] `demo_summary.md` (dev documentation)

## Phase 2: Distributed Container Management System

### Core Components to Implement

#### 1. Container Discovery Service
**File**: `app/core/orchestration/container_discovery.py`
- Auto-detect new container instances joining the network
- Health monitoring of remote containers
- Container capability assessment
- Network topology mapping

#### 2. Remote Container Registry  
**File**: `app/core/orchestration/container_registry.py`
- Register/deregister remote containers
- Track container capabilities and resources
- Maintain container health status
- Handle container lifecycle events

#### 3. Distributed Agent Manager
**File**: `app/core/agents/distributed_agent_manager.py`  
- Deploy agents to optimal remote containers
- Load balancing across container cluster
- Agent lifecycle management across containers
- Failure recovery and agent migration

#### 4. Container Communication Hub
**File**: `app/infrastructure/messaging/container_hub.py`
- Secure inter-container communication
- Message routing between containers
- Event broadcasting for container events
- API proxy for remote container access

#### 5. Cluster Orchestration API
**File**: `app/api/cluster.py`
- REST API for cluster management
- Container discovery endpoints
- Agent deployment to remote containers  
- Cluster health and status monitoring

### Integration Points

#### API Extensions
- Add cluster management endpoints to existing API
- Extend agent management for remote deployment
- Add container discovery and health endpoints

#### Database Schema
- Container registry in Redis
- Agent-to-container mappings
- Cluster topology and health data

#### Docker Integration  
- Enhanced container detection
- Cross-container networking
- Container health monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking

- [ ] Add event broadcasting system
- [ ] Create message routing logic

### Task 6: API Integration

- [ ] Create cluster monitoring endpoints

### Task 7: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create distributed system tests
- [ ] Test container discovery functionality
- [ ] Validate remote agent deployment
- [ ] Test cluster failover scenarios

## Technical Architecture

### Container Discovery Flow
```
1. Central Manager starts up
2. Scans network for compatible containers
3. Registers discovered containers
4. Monitors container health continuously
5. Updates container registry in real-time
```

### Remote Agent Deployment Flow  
```
1. User requests agent creation via API
2. Central Manager selects optimal container
3. Deploys agent to remote container
4. Monitors agent health and performance
5. Handles agent migration if container fails
```

### Container Communication
```
Central Manager ←→ Container Hub ←→ Remote Containers
                      ↕
                 Redis Registry
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Repository is production-ready
- [ ] Container discovery works automatically
- [ ] Remote containers are properly registered
- [ ] Agents can be deployed to remote containers
- [ ] Central manager can manage distributed agents
- [ ] System handles container failures gracefully
- [ ] All APIs work with distributed setup
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
- Network connectivity between containers
- Security of inter-container communication  
- Container resource management
- Agent state synchronization

### Rollback Strategy
- Git checkpoints at each major phase
- Ability to revert to monolithic mode
- Container health fallback mechanisms
- Agent migration rollback procedures
